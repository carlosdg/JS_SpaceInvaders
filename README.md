# JS_SpaceInvaders
<h2> Brief description: </h2>
<p>
My implementation of the game "Space Invaders" in JavaScript, based on the YouTube videos of <q>Max Wihlborg</q>
</p>

<h2> Author: </h2>
<p>	Carlos Domínguez García </p>

<h2> Tested on: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>	Google Chrome   - 60.0.3112.113  </li>
  <li>  Mozilla Firefox - 55.0.2         </li>
</ul>

<h2> Controls: </h2>
  <p> Use the arrow keys (<- & ->) to move the cannon. </p>
  <p> Use the space bar to shoot. You can only shoot a bullet at a time. You can shoot again when the bullet dissapears from the canvas, or you can let the space bar pressed to shoot as soon as possible </p>

<h2> Update </h2>
<p>
    Most of the game is currently implemented. The only thing about the game itself left are the defences. After that there are some more things that I want to improve, like the collision detection. And I want to add some extra features like letting the user pause the game explicitly (right now it can be paused by going to another tab thanks to requestAnimationFrame).
