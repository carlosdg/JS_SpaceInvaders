# JS_SpaceInvaders
<h2> Brief description: </h2>
<p>
My implementation of the game "Space Invaders" in JavaScript, based on the YouTube videos of <q>Max Wihlborg</q>
</p>

<h2> Author: </h2>
<p>	Carlos Domínguez García </p>

<h2> Tested on: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>	Google Chrome   - 60.0.3112.101  </li>
  <li>  Mozilla Firefox - 55.0.2         </li>
</ul>

<h2> Controls: </h2>
  <p> Use the arrow keys (<- & ->) to move the cannon. </p>
  <p> Use the space bar to shoot. You can only shoot a bullet at a time. You can shoot again when the bullet dissapears from the canvas, or you can let the space bar pressed to shoot as soon as possible </p>

<h2> Note </h2>
<p> There are still plenty of features to implement:
    <ul>
        <li> Keep track of scores </li>
        <li> Have the aliens move faster as time goes by </li>
        <li> Stop the game when the user loses </li>
        <li> Add user lifes </li>
        <li> Add levels (the game doesn't end until the user loses, once all the aliens dies, there have to be a new batch of them) </li>
        <li> Add the defence elements </li>
    </ul>
</p>
