## Brief description
My implementation of a game based on "Space Invaders" in JavaScript. I took a lot of ideas of the implementation from [the YouTube videos of Max Wihlborg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerQ5M9p4YY).
The goal of this project was just to have fun and learn JavaScript.

## Tested on
- Google Chrome   - 60.0.3112.113
- Mozilla Firefox - 55.0.2


## Controls
Use the arrow keys (<- & ->) to move the cannon.

Use the space bar to shoot. You can only shoot a bullet at a time. You can shoot again when the bullet dissapears from the canvas, or you can let the space bar pressed to shoot as soon as possible.


## Update
Most of the game is currently implemented. The only thing about the game itself left are the defences. After that there are some more things that I would like to do better like the collision detection. And I want to add some extra features like letting the user pause the game explicitly (right now it can be paused by going to another tab thanks to requestAnimationFrame).


## Demo
You can try the game at [the github web page of this project](https://carlosdg.github.io/SpaceInvadersGame/)
